<p> This project is a basic Face ID system inspired by Google's facial recognition technologies.
 It offers a simple, secure, and privacy-friendly way to authenticate users through facial features using a standard webcam.
 Designed for learning and experimentation, the system combines modern web technologies with intuitive user interaction,
 making it accessible for developers and enthusiasts interested in biometrics and web security. </p>
